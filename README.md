# LungSegmentation

This repository contains the model trained for segmenting MR lung images as described in:

Weng A et al. Deep learning-based segmentation of the lung in MR-images acquired by a stack-of-spirals trajectory at ultra-short echo-times. XXX 

The images used for training were exclusively acquired by a stack-of-stars UTE MR pulse sequence on a 3T Magnetom Prisma Scanner in healthy volunteers and patients suffering from cystic fibrosis.
